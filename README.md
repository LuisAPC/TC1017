This is where all my codes for TC1017 will be.

**TC1017** was:
> My first programming class I took in my University

## It covers the *following topics*:
You can check my [blog](https://luisapcblog.wordpress.com/) for more information and code explanations

1. Use of comments (Improving in each task)
2. C++ Good Style coding conventions (Improving in each task)
